We're gonna need a bigger :boat:!

## Prerequisites

You'll need

* Stattleship [API Access Token from https://api.stattleship.com](https://api.stattleship.com)

# Configuration

There are two ways to configure the gem.

Stattleship.configure do |config|
  config.api_token = YOUR_TOKEN
end
```

or via a `.env`

```
STATTLESHIP_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## API Documentation

* [Developer API Reference](http://developers.stattleship.com/)

## Examples

Check out some [examples](examples/README.md) of how to make API calls.

It's dead simple.

* Build and set parameters
* Use that to fetch data
* Use fully populated PORO's with real Ruby datatypes (DateTime, Integers, bool) not just JSON strings

The pattern is pretty much as follows:

```rb
query_params = Stattleship::Params::BasketballGameLogsParams.new
query_params.player_id = 'nba-stephen-curry'
query_params.since = '1 week ago'
game_logs = Stattleship::BasketballGameLogs.fetch(params: query_params)
pp game_logs.first
```

**That's it.**

If you want to see what the example JSON responses are, have a look in [fixtures](https://github.com/stattleship/stattleship-ruby/tree/master/spec/fixtures) as there are samples for each sport.

## Apps

We're using the Stattleship API and this gem! You can, too.
